            It is impossible to overstate the importance of responsive web
            design in boosting user experience. Responsive web design ensures a
            consistent user experience across all screen sizes. It eliminates
            extraneous website elements and gives users a fantastic online
            experience.

            Google has released Core Web Vitals, a suite of new metrics for
            measuring website speed and real-time user experience. To determine
            a website's page experience score, these criteria will be added to
            its existing signals. The Core Web Vitals will also be a component
            of a significant Google algorithm upgrade (due in March 2021) that
            will give users a new way to rate and evaluate websites based on the
            page experience they deliver.
